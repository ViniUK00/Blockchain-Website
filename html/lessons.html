        <h2>What is blockchain?</h2>
    <p>Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), 
        makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and 
        transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.  
        A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. 
        When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is 
        distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized 
        distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. 
        No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications 
        to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent.</p>

    <h4>Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners</h4>
    

    <ul>
        <li>Blocks</li>
        <li>Miners</li>
        <li>Nodes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Blocks</h3>
    <p>Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The data in the block.</li>
        <li>A 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block 
            is created, which then generates a block header hash</li>
        <li>The hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. 
            It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic
         hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce 
         and hash unless it is mined.  </p>

    <img src="../html/imgs/block.png" alt="Block of blockchains">
    <h3>Miners</h3>
    <p>Miners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.</p>
    <p>In a blockchain every block has its own unique nonce and hash, but also 
        references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block 
        isn't easy, especially on large chains.</p>
    <p>Miners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem of 
        finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is only 
        32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible nonce-hash
         combinations that must be mined before the right one is found. When 
         that happens miners are said to have found the "golden nonce" and their 
         block is added to the chain. </p>
    <p>Making a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not 
        just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after. 
        This is why it's extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. 
        Think of it as "safety in math" since finding golden nonces requires an 
        enormous amount of time and computing power.</p>
    <p>When a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes
         on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.</p>
    <img src="../html/imgs/mine.webp" alt="Miners" height="600" width="1100">
    <h3>Nodes</h3>
    <p>One of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is decentralization. 
        No one computer or organization can own the chain. Instead, it is a distributed
         ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of 
         electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network 
         functioning. </p>
    <p>Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must 
        algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be updated, 
        trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent, every action in the 
        ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each participant is given a unique 
        alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.</p>
    <p>Combining public information with a system of checks-and-balances helps the 
        blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users. 
        Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of trust 
        via technology. </p>

    <h2>How Are Blockchains Used?</h2>
    <p>As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store data about monetary 
        transactions. Today, there are more than 10,000 other cryptocurrency systems 
        running on blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is actually a reliable 
        way of storing data about other types of transactions as well.</p>

    <p>Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, 
        Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever, and a host of others. For example, IBM has 
        created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products t
        ake to get to their locations</p>

    <p>Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, 
        salmonella, and listeria, as well as hazardous materials being accidentally
         introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the source of 
         these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. 
         Using blockchain gives brands the ability to track a food product’s route 
         from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally, its delivery. 
         If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back 
         through each stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also 
         now see everything else it may have come in contact with, allowing the 
         identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives.
          This is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms 
          of blockchain implementation.</p>

    <h3>Banking and Finance</h3>
    <p>Perhaps no industry stands to benefit from integrating blockchain into
         its business operations more than banking. Financial institutions only operate 
         during business hours, usually five days a week. That means if you try to
          deposit a check on Friday at 6 p.m., you will likely have to wait until
           Monday morning to see that money hit your account. Even if you do make 
           your deposit during business hours, the transaction can still take one 
           to three days to verify due to the sheer volume of transactions that banks 
           need to settle. Blockchain, on the other hand, never sleeps.</p>

    <p>By integrating blockchain into banks, consumers can see their 
        transactions processed in as little as 10 minutes—basically the 
        time it takes to add a block to the blockchain, regardless of holidays 
        or the time of day or week. With blockchain, banks also have the opportunity
         to exchange funds between institutions more quickly and securely. 
         In the stock trading business, for example, the settlement and clearing 
         process can take up to three days (or longer, if trading internationally), 
         meaning that the money and shares are frozen for that period of time.</p>

    <p>Given the size of the sums involved, even the few days that the money is 
        in transit can carry significant costs and risks for banks.</p>

    <h3>Currency</h3>
    <p>Blockchain forms the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 
        The U.S. dollar is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Under this central 
        authority system, a user’s data and currency are technically at the whim 
        of their bank or government. If a user’s bank is hacked, the client’s private 
        information is at risk. If the client’s bank collapses or the client lives in 
        a country with an unstable government, the value of their currency may be at 
        risk. In 2008, several failing banks were bailed out—partially using taxpayer 
        money. These are the worries out of which Bitcoin was first conceived and 
        developed.</p>
    <p>By spreading its operations across a network of computers, blockchain 
        allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to operate without the need for
         a central authority. This not only reduces risk but also eliminates many 
         of the processing and transaction fees. It can also give those in countries
          with unstable currencies or financial infrastructures a more stable currency
           with more applications and a wider network of individuals and institutions 
           with whom they can do business, both domestically and internationally.</p>
    <p>Using <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-wallet.asp">cryptocurrency wallets</a> for savings accounts or as a means 
        of payment is especially profound for those who have no state 
        identification. Some countries may be war-torn or have governments 
        that lack any real infrastructure to provide identification. 
        Citizens of such countries may not have access to savings or brokerage 
        accounts—and, therefore, no way to safely store wealth.</p>
    <h3>Healthcare</h3>
    <p>Healthcare providers can leverage blockchain to securely store their patients’ medical records. When a medical record is generated and signed, 
        it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with the proof 
        and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records
         could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key, so that they 
         are only accessible by certain individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.</p>
    <h2>Who Invented Blockchain?</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and 
        W. Scott Stornetta, two mathematicians who wanted to implement a system 
        where document time stamps could not be tampered with.1 In the late 1990s,
         cypherpunk Nick Szabo proposed using a blockchain to secure a digital 
         payments system, known as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bit-gold.asp">bit gold</a> (which was never implemented)</p>

    <h2>What’s Next for Blockchain?</h2>
    <p>With many practical applications for the technology already being 
        implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for 
        itself in no small part because of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. 
        As a buzzword on the tongue of every investor in the nation, blockchain 
        stands to make business and government operations more accurate, efficient, 
        secure, and cheap, with fewer middlemen.</p>
    <p>As we prepare to head into the third decade of blockchain, 
        it’s no longer a question of if legacy companies will catch on to 
        the technology—it’s a question of when. Today, we see a proliferation 
        of NFTs and the tokenization of assets. The next decades will prove to 
        be an important period of growth for blockchain.</p>
